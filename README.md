## Mission Statement

A sleek, secure, and transparent social media platform for web developers.

<br>

<br>

## Description

In today's world, it's hard to find a single person who owns a computer and doesn't have at least one social media account. Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and TikToc have become staples for today's internet users. Their existence has completely changed how we as humans communicate with one another, sometimes for the better, but other times for the worst. Monetized algorithms now determine how users are able to interact with information feeds on daily basis; People are become more and more fixated on their online social presence, and less focused on actual human interaction; Social media is completely warping how individuals view themselves, how they value themselves, and what they now aspire to be as people. It's changing how we treat one another; And it's changing how we treat ourselves. In short, social media has become a toxic disease that continues to efficiently warp the minds of their users. 

For those who've broken free from the chains of mainstream social media platforms, we've yet to find refuge with any suitable alternative. And that's exactly why we made Cactus Social - to provide individuals with the functionality they need to effectively and efficiently communicate with one another - without the toxic fluff. Tired of computer algorithms telling you what populates on your news feed or timeline? Sick of the payed advertisements and posts taking over news about your friends? Are you ready for something just as elegant as Twitter and Slack without the complicated user interface? Then welcome to Cactus Social.

## Current State of Application


While Cactus Social aspires to one day serve the broader population of internet users, it is being launched as a platform to serve the social needs of software developers. Like LinkedIn, you'll be able to build a profile that prospective employers, friends, and connections can easily view and learn about you. Like Facebook, you'll be able to view public announcements, browse public events, and connect with friends. Like Slack and Discord, you'll be able to join or moderate threads, add formatted posts and comments, and react to posts. And like Signal, you'll be able to connect with a friend or a group of friends securely in complete privacy.
