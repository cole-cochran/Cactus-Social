*The idea was to build out the pages and components in figma as well as work on logo and front end design*
<!-- figma 2 -->
![figma model pages](figma_2.PNG)
*Examples of sign up, login, error pages, and dashboard*

# Ideas for future development:
- friend requests
- allow users to only see threads they are a part of 
- privatized thread creation
- add event functionality
